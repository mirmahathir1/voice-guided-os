TARGET ACTION: "{action_description}"

You have two images:
1. Original full screenshot (for context)
2. Cropped cell with 2x2 grid overlay

The 2x2 grid uses the same labeling as the main grid:
- X-axis: labeled 1-2 (left to right)
- Y-axis: labeled A-B (top to bottom)

Select the cell containing the exact click target.

Respond ONLY with JSON: {{"X": "<1 or 2>", "Y": "<A or B>"}}
